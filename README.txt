Stuart Mackenzie - Assignment 3 Submission - Telling a story with data
=======================================================================


For this assignment I have created an interactive website. 

This should work by loading the file 'index.html' in your internet browser.

To manage changes to files during the creation of this assignment I have been using a repository on github.

Repostiory URL: https://github.com/d1sc0/odi_assignment3

Equally this means the website can be viewed live using github pages
